# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking

- **Renderer-neutral controller**: focus and soft-keyboard APIs move from
  `TerminalController` to `TerminalView`. Pass a `FocusNode` for imperative
  focus control and configure soft-keyboard access with `showKeyboard`.
- **Controller contract**: `TerminalController` supports one attached
  `TerminalView`. A second concurrent attachment throws `StateError`.
- **Callback configuration**: `onBell`, `onOutput`, `onPwdChanged`, `onResize`,
  and `onTitleChanged` are setter-only. Retain callback references if their
  identity is needed elsewhere.
- **Removed public types**: `KeyboardState` and `TerminalScrollPosition` are no
  longer exported. Use `FocusNode`, `TerminalView.showKeyboard`, and the
  standard `ScrollPosition` interface.

### Changed

- **Incremental rendering**: frame building uses libghostty's dirty-row
  iteration and bulk cleanup to reduce row scans and binding calls.
- **Resize lifecycle**: `onResize` reports only after `TerminalView` commits a
  measured grid; assigning it later immediately reports that grid.
  Cell-pixel-only changes skip the callback, and in-band output is emitted
  first.

### Fixed

- **Cursor viewport state**: cursor and IME preedit rendering honor whether
  the cursor has a valid viewport position and use its reported visual style.
- **Text input recovery**: terminal clients reconnect when another input client
  takes the platform text input connection, including while composition is
  active.
- **Keyboard and IME input**: AltGr printable input no longer emits synthetic
  Control or Alt bytes, Kitty keyboard reports include Caps Lock and Num Lock,
  and newline/deletion deduplication no longer duplicates or suppresses input.
- **Pointer input**: mouse and stylus button changes remain accurate during a
  gesture, stylus drags select text, and a gesture no longer switches between
  selection and terminal mouse reporting.
- **View updates**: controller swaps transfer terminal focus correctly, and
  changing `TerminalView.fontData` refreshes cell metrics.
- **Terminal glyph rendering**: Nerd Font symbols use common fallback families,
  fit their cell without distortion, and preserve adjacent spacing. Operator
  ligatures remain stable across complete runs.
- **Kitty graphics rendering**: unchanged and replacing images remain drawable,
  decode pressure is bounded, replacement pixels and geometry publish
  atomically, and placement geometry refreshes during layout and resizing.

## 0.0.5

### Added

- **Clipboard writes**: `TerminalController.onClipboardWrite` forwards atomic,
  binary-safe OSC 52 and iTerm2 clipboard requests so applications can apply
  their own platform and security policies. If the callback throws, the
  initiating write finishes terminal processing before rethrowing the error.
- **Idle scrollback compression**: attached terminal views schedule bounded
  compression after terminal and viewport activity settles, reducing retained
  scrollback memory without competing with rendering.

### Changed

- **Kitty graphics caching**: unchanged placement snapshots are reused across
  frames, while image generations invalidate cached images and stale pending
  decodes. This avoids repeated traversal, sorting, and eviction work without
  displaying stale image data.
- **Color behavior**: `ColorPalette.generated()` uses libghostty palette
  generation, and terminal color-scheme reports use perceived background
  luminance.
- **Published package contents**: tests, benchmark tooling, generated API
  documentation, build outputs, and coverage data are excluded.

### Fixed

- **IME preedit layout**: ZWJ emoji, skin-tone emoji sequences, combining
  marks, and variation selectors are measured as grapheme clusters using
  libghostty's terminal width rules.
- **Viewport scrolling**: scroll-controller pixel offsets map to absolute
  terminal rows regardless of the current viewport position.
- **Windows text input**: platform text input binds to the `TerminalView`'s
  owning Flutter view and reconnects when that view changes.

## 0.0.4

### Breaking

- **Selection APIs**: selection is backed by libghostty. `TerminalSelection`
  and `TerminalSelectionMode` are removed, `TerminalConfig.wordPattern`
  moves to `TerminalGestureSettings.wordBoundaries`, and gesture toggles
  are explicit settings.

### Added

- **Terminal links**: `TerminalView.linkSettings` detects OSC 8 links,
  text URLs, file paths, and custom regex links.
- **Controller APIs**: `selectRange`, `hasSelection`, `pwd`, and
  `onPwdChanged` expose selection and working-directory state.
- **Glyph Protocol**: `TerminalConfig.glyphProtocol` toggles Glyph Protocol
  APC handling.

### Changed

- **Rendering pipeline**: selection, cursor viewport state, and cell metadata
  use refreshed libghostty render snapshots.

## 0.0.3

### Breaking

- **Flutter SDK floor**: requires Dart 3.12 and Flutter 3.44.

### Added

- **IME composition**: composing text appears at the terminal cursor
  and works with platform text input.
- **Sprite glyph rendering**: box drawing, block elements, Braille,
  Powerline, geometric shapes, and legacy computing glyphs render
  with built-in glyphs.
- **Shared render caches**: `TerminalScope` lets multiple terminal
  views share compatible rendering resources.
- **APC buffer limits**: `TerminalConfig.apcBufferLimit` controls how
  much APC payload data the terminal accepts.

### Changed

- **Rendering pipeline**: terminal frames share rendering caches and do
  less repeated work between frames.

### Fixed

- **Keyboard input**: shifted printable keys and IME editing produce
  the expected terminal text.
- **Rendering accuracy**: erased backgrounds, cursor shape, cell
  metrics, and sprite glyphs render more consistently.

## 0.0.2

### Breaking

- **Theme colors move into `ColorPalette`**: `TerminalTheme` no longer
  takes `background`, `foreground`, and `ansiColors` directly. Build a
  `ColorPalette` once and pass it in, so palettes are something you
  can share, swap, or `copyWith` on their own.
- **Cursor and selection colors can adapt to the cell under them**: the
  color fields take `DynamicColor?` now. Use
  `DynamicColor.cellForeground()` / `.cellBackground()` to follow the
  cell, or `DynamicColor.fixed(c)` for the old static behavior.
- **`selectedText` is a method**: call `controller.selectedText()` for
  plain text, or pass a `FormatterFormat` to get VT or HTML for
  rich-clipboard copy.
- **Bold no longer switches to the bright palette by default**: expect
  slightly different bold colors; set `boldIsBright: true` to restore
  the old behavior.

### Added

- **Kitty graphics**: programs that emit images (previewers, image
  viewers, some editors) render inside the widget. Cap the cache via
  `TerminalConfig.kittyImageStorageLimit`; zero disables.
- **Transparent background**: `TerminalTheme.backgroundOpacity` makes
  the default background translucent so the terminal can compose over
  a translucent window or other widgets. `backgroundOpacityCells`
  extends it to cells with their own bg color.
- **More theme knobs**: `CursorTheme.text` (glyph color under a block
  cursor), `TerminalTheme.boldColor` (forced bold color), and
  `SelectionTheme.foreground` (selected-glyph tint).
- **`ColorPalette.generated()`**: derives indices 16–255 from your base
  16 plus background and foreground so the extended palette blends
  instead of clashing with the fixed xterm cube.

### Changed

- **Dirty-row rendering**: frames rebuild only rows that changed, so
  idle terminals cost much less CPU.

## 0.0.1

Initial release.

### Added

- **`TerminalView`**: a Flutter widget that renders a terminal and
  adapts its input to the host. Mouse and keyboard on desktop, touch
  and soft keyboard on mobile, both on web.
- **`TerminalController`**: owns the terminal and bridges it with the
  view. Connects to a backend (PTY, SSH, socket) via `onOutput`,
  `onResize`, `onBell`, and `onTitleChanged`. Exposes I/O (`write`,
  `sendText`, `sendKey`), selection (`selectAll`, `selectWord`,
  `selectLine`), focus, scrolling, paste, clear, and mode toggling.
- **Themes**: ANSI 16, 256-color, and truecolor palettes; cursor
  shape, color, and blink; hyperlink style; font family, size, and
  fallback; minimum contrast. Immutable and `lerp`-able.
- **Wide characters**: CJK, color emoji, VS16, and combining marks
  render correctly; selection snaps to whole cells.
- **Mouse selection**: drag, double-click word, triple-click line,
  and Alt+drag block. Configurable via `TerminalGestureSettings`.
- **Shortcuts**: built-in copy, paste, select all, and clear with
  platform-aware defaults (Cmd on macOS/iOS, Ctrl+Shift on
  Linux/Windows). Extend or replace with any Flutter `Intent`.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks**: idle and highlighted styles with click
  hit-testing.
- **Cross-platform**: Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web (WASM), Windows.
