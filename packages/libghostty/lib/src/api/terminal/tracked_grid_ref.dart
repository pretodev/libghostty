/// follows its cell as the terminal page list changes due to scrolling,
/// pruning, resize/reflow, and similar mutations. Call [snapshot] immediately
/// before reading cell data, and call [dispose] when done.

/// If the tracked cell is discarded by reset, screen replacement, or terminal
/// disposal, [hasValue] becomes false and [snapshot] / [positionIn] return null.
/// Calling [dispose] more than once is safe; every other member throws
/// [StateError] after disposal.

/// Not intended for render loops. Use [RenderState] with [RowIterator] and
/// [CellIterator] for performance-critical rendering.
